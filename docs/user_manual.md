This application/website is provided to users who have tons of ingredients and are unsure of what to cook using those ingredients. This application/website will allow users to input the ingredients they have into our generator. To do so, the user types their ingredient in the ingredient box. If a suggestion pops up click on that suggestion and then click the button “add ingredient” to add the ingredient to the box below “Your Ingredients”. Repeat this until there is a list of all the ingredients the user wants. After all ingredients are listed and provided, users will be able to see a list of recipes that include those ingredients. To get the list recipes the user must click on “Generate Recipe” to see the list of recipes. After the user selects which recipe they’d like to view or use, they will then see a full view and details of the ingredients needed for the recipe, how long it’ll take to cook the dish, and how to actually make the dish step by step.
